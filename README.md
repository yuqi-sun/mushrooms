### Mushrooms: to eat or not to eat, that is the question

A project realised for the course Data Intensive Applications (academic year 2019/20).
The goal of this project is to predict the edibility of mushrooms given certain characteristics.
The dataset considered includes mushrooms belonging to 23 different species of *lamellate* mushrooms (mushrooms of the order *Agaricales*) of the *Agaricus* and
*Lepiota* genes.

The analysis concluded that, using odour alone, it is possible to identify almost all poisonous mushrooms (about 97%) and about 20% of the edible mushrooms;
in addition, 96.5% of the odourless mushrooms can still be eaten. In the absence of odour, we can use the colour of the spore print, the gills spacing and size and
its population type.

In general:

- prefer mushrooms with an almond or aniseed smell and avoid altogether those with other odours;
- in case they have no smell:
  - size of the gills: mushrooms with wide gills tend to be edible, narrow ones poisonous;
  - distance between gills: gills that are very crowded together are generally edible;
  - colour of spore print: avoid white and green spore print.

In any case, consult an experts before eating mushrooms.
